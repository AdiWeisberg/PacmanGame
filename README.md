- Csvtojava: Gets a tile file CSV and converts it into the Geographic Layers object in java.
- JAVA_to_KML: Converts the JAVA object to a KML file.
- MultiCSV: Gets a folder of files and enters it recursively and creates an array of all the files that are in the folder.
3. Geom:

# Get_Started:
In order to start you may want to have CSV files to see results.
Open the CsvToKml class to run it and it will ask you to register routing to CSV file or folder,
run and then the computer will open a file with a new KML extension that you can open in Google Earth and see the layers The geographical areas.

# Understand_deeply: Take a look at the  class GeoInfo_system_Diagram and the class Test.
